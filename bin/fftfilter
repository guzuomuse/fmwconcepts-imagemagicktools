# NAME: FFTFILTER 
# 
# PURPOSE: To perform filtering on an image in the frequency domain.
# 
# DESCRIPTION: FFTFILTER performs filtering on an image in the frequency
# domain using a frequency domain filter image. Two inputs are required. The 
# image and a grayscale frequency domain filter. The image is transformed to 
# the frequency domain using -fft and the filter image is then multiplied with 
# the Fourier transform of the image and the product is then returned to the 
# spatial domain using -ift. Any alpha channel on the filter will be removed 
# automatically before processing. If the image has an alpha channel it will 
# not be processed, but simply copied from the input to the output.
# 
# OPTIONS: 
# 
# No options are required
# 
# The filter image must be appropriately centered and padded with black to 
# the same size as the input image.
# 
# REQUIREMENTS: IM version 6.5.4-7 or higher. HDRI is not required, but Q8 
# compilations of IM are not recommended as it will not carry enough precision. 
# Also requires the FFTW delegate library.
# 
# See http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/fourier_transforms/fourier.html 
# for more details about the Fourier Transform with ImageMagick.
# 
# CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms, 
# nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and 
# foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
